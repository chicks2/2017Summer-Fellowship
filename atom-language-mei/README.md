# MEI language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to MEI files in Atom.

Originally copied from the [XML language package](https://github.com/atom/language-xml).

Currently, this package merely enables XML features for ".mei" files. Additional MEI-specific
features will (probably) be added in the future.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [XML TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/xml.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
