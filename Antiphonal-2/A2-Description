         <additions>
            <p>The folio has two kinds of corrections: erasures (the ghostly letters are still visible)
               and pasting a piece of parer over a word to be omitted (too many alleluias).</p>

      <bindingDesc>
         <p>There is evidence of three tabs, all successively more robust and some reinforced by paper.
            These must have broken off due to continuous use.  Each replacement was made stronger than
            the previous.</p>
